Hi Holger,

Thanks for your message. I understand the importance of maintaining a balanced workload across our team, and fully agree that everyone should share the responsibilities. I appreciate your recognition of my contributions, and am committed to contributing effectively and fairly.

You're aware, I hope, of my unique way of operating. While it can be perceived as less structured or conventional, I want to assure you that I am commited to our team's success as well as the portal network.
I often find that periods of intense focus enable me to produce high-quality work and drive innovations.

As you are aware, my approach tends to be concentrated and perhaps unconventional, and I am grateful that you enable me to work in this way. I only want to produce high-quality work, and I am dedicated to our team and the Portal Network project.
I do understand this approach may sometimes result in an imbalance in my workload or contribution in the monorepo, and I appreciate your understanding in this matter, while also acknowledging that I can do better.

Regarding the Trie PR, I recognize that progress has been slower than anticipated, and I regret the delays. Balancing the project's complexity with preparations for the upcoming conference has been a challenge. Most of my resources have been allocated between these two tasks. Rest assured, the delays with the Trie PR are not for lack of effort.

This week, my primary focus will be on the portal network conference. After that, I'm open to working together to ensure a more steady flow of deliverables. I'm certainly open to suggestions you might have on this matter.

In the near future, I need to discuss my compensation due to some upcoming changes in my personal financial responsibilities. At the end of summer, my cost of living in will increase significantly, including a substantial rise in my rent. Additionally, my wife will be having necessary hip surgery and will be unable to work for about a year, making me the sole financial provider during this period.

I'm hopeful that we can maintain open lines of communication on these issues. Your understanding and support mean a lot. Thanks for your time and leadership.

Best,
Scotty

Dear Holger,

Thank you for your detailed message, which underscores the importance of fair work distribution within the team. I completely agree with this and am committed to contributing effectively.
As you are aware, my approach tends to be concentrated and perhaps unconventional, and I am grateful that you enable me to work in this way. I only want to produce high-quality work, and I am dedicated to our team and the Portal Network project.
With regard to the Trie PR, I regret the delays. The project's complexity and the intense preparations for the upcoming conference have been challenging to balance. Rest assured, the delays are not from a lack of effort.
Given the conference's proximity, I kindly request to concentrate on this event for the rest of the week. Afterward, I'm eager to work with you on a system that ensures steady deliverables, aligning with your vision for a more balanced workload.
Soon, I'd like to discuss my compensation in light of significant impending cost of living increases. The rent on my home will increase by summer's end, a typical occurrence in our local area. Concurrently, my wife will undergo hip surgery, pausing her career as a circus coach and aerialist during her year-long recovery. I'll temporarily be the sole financial provider in our household.
I value our open communication environment, and your understanding and support are truly appreciated.

Thank you for your leadership, Holger.

Best,
[Your Name]

| Ethereum Execution (Eth 1.0) Client build in TypeScript/JavaScript. |
| --- |

Note: there is no current release on npm and the releases from the [standalone repository](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-client) are outdated. Use the latest `master` to run the client. There will be an up-to-date client release soon (Fall 2021) under a scoped `@ethereumjs/client` naming scheme. 

# INTRODUCTION

The EthereumJS Client is an Ethereum Execution Client (similar to [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) or [Nethermind](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind)) written in `TypeScript`/`JavaScript`, the non-Smart-Contract language Ethereum dApp developers are most familiar with. It is targetet to be a client for research and development and not meant to be used in production on `mainnet` for the forseable future (out of ressource and security considerations). 

Potential use cases are:

- Sync the main Ethereum networks (`mainnet`, `goerli`, `rinkeby`,...)
- Set up your own local development networks (PoA Clique)
- Run a network with your own custom [EthereumJS VM](../vm)
- Analyze what's in the Ethereum `mainnet` [transaction pool](./lib/sync/txpool.ts)
- Run experiments on Ethereum browser sync (see [examples](./EXAMPLES.md))
- ...

The client has an extremely modular design by building upon central other libraries in the EthereumJS monorepo ([VM](../vm), [Merkle Patricia Tree](../trie), [Blockchain](../blockchain), [Block](../block), [tx](../tx) and [Common](../common)) and is therefore extremely well suited for a deep dive into Ethereum protocol development.

We invite you to explore and would be delighted if you give us feedback on your journey! üôÇ ‚ù§Ô∏è

# SETUP

## INSTALL

```shell
npm install @ethereumjs/client // Release during Fall 2021
```

For the `ethereumjs` CLI command to work run:

```shell
npm link
```

As long as there is no up-to-date client release on npm and for development purposes the client can be used like this:

1. Clone the monorepo with `git clone https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo.git`
2. Set things up and install dependencies (see [monorepo docs](../../config/MONOREPO.md))
3. Run the client with `npm run client:start` from the `client` root directory (e.g. `packages/client` if working on a local copy of the monorepo)

Furthermore see the [Technical Guidelines](#technical-guidelines) to dive directly into some more in-depth development info.

## USAGE

### Introduction

You can get up the client up and running by going to the shell and run:

```shell
# npm installation
ethereumjs

# GitHub installation
npm run client:start
```

And pass in CLI paramters like:

```shell
# npm installation
ethereumjs --network=goerli

# GitHub installation
npm run client:start -- --network=goerli
```

To see a help page with the full list of client options available run:

```shell
ethereumjs --help
```

### Supported Networks

The EthereumJS client is tightly integrated with the EthereumJS [Common](../common) library and gets its network state and information from this library and supports all networks support by `Common`.

The main supported networks are:

- `mainnet`
- `rinkeby`
- `ropsten`
- `goerli`

Use the CLI `--network` option to switch the network:

```shell
ethereumjs --network=rinkeby
```


#### Client Customization

For getting a start on customizing the client and use programatically see the code from [./bin/cli.ts](./bin/cli.ts) to get an idea how an [EthereumClient](./lib/client.ts) instance is invoked programatically.

We would love to hear feedback from you on what you are planning and exchange on ideas how a programmatic exposure of the client API can be achieved more systematically and useful for third-party development use.

## API

[API Reference](./docs/README.md)

See also this [diagram](./diagram/client.svg) for an overview of the client structure with the initialization and message flow.

## JSON-RPC

### Overview

You can expose a [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) interface along a client run with:

```shell
ethereumjs --rpc
```

To run just the server without syncing:

```shell
ethereumjs --rpc --maxPeers=0
```

Currently only a small subset of `RPC` methods are implemented.(\*) You can have a look at the
[./lib/rpc/modules/](./lib/rpc/modules) source folder or the tracking issue
[#1114](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/1114) for an overview.

(*) Side note: implementing RPC methods is actually an extremely thankful task for a first-time
contribution on the project *hint\* _hint_. üòÑ

### API Examples

You can use `cURL` to request data from an API endpoint. Here is a simple example for
[web3_clientVersion](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#web3_clientversion):

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"web3_clientVersion", "params": []}' http://localhost:8545
```

Note that `"params": []` can also be omitted in this case.

Or - somewhat more convenient and with formatted output - with a tool like [httpie](http://httpie.org/):

```shell
http POST http://localhost:8545 jsonrpc=2.0 id=1 method=web3_clientVersion params:=[]
```

Note the `:=` separator for the `params` parameter to
[indicate](https://httpie.org/docs#non-string-json-fields) raw `JSON` as an input.

This will give you an output like the following:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "EthereumJS/0.0.5/darwin/node12.15.0"
}
```

Here's an example for a call on an endpoint with the need for parameters. The following call uses
the [eth_getBlockByNumer](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getblockbynumber) endpoint
to request data for block number 436 (you can use an tool like
[RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) for conversion to `hex`):

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["0x1b4", true],"id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

Same with `httpie`:

```shell
http POST http://localhost:8545 jsonrpc=2.0 id=1 method=eth_getBlockByNumber params:='["0x1b4",true]'
```

Output:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "header": {
      "bloom": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

## Design

**Goals**

Contributors should aim to achieve the following goals when making design decisions:

- **Loosely coupled components**: Components should require as little knowledge of the definitions of
  other components as possible. This reduces dependencies between PRs and encourages contributors
  to work in parallel. It also improves extensibility of the code as new features like sharding
  and libp2p support are added.
- **Easily tested**: The design should make testing of individual components as easy as possible.
  This goes hand in hand with the previous goal of loose coupling.
- **Readable code**: More readable code should encourage more contributions from the community and help
  with bug fixing.
- **Well documented**: Similar to above, this will help both contributors and users of the project.

The current design tries to achieves the goals of loose coupling and ease of testing by using an
event-driven architecture where possible. Readability is improved by using features of JavaScript
ES6 such as classes, async/await, promises, arrow functions, for...of, template literals and
destructuring assignment among others. Shorter names are used when possible and long functions are
broken up into smaller helpers, along with TypeDoc annotations for most methods and parameters.
Documentation is auto-generated from TypeDoc comments and many examples of usage are provided (TO DO).

We will now briefly describe the directory structure and main components of the Ethereumjs client
to help contributors better understand how the project is organized.

**Directory structure**

- `/bin` Contains the CLI script for the `ethereumjs` command.
- `/docs` Contains auto-generated API docs.
- `/lib/blockchain` Contains the `Chain` class.
- `/lib/net` Contains all of the network layer classes including `Peer`, `Protocol` and its subclasses, `Server` and its subclasses, and `PeerPool`.
- `/lib/service` Contains the main Ethereum services (`FullEthereumService` and `LightEthereumService`).
- `/lib/rpc` Contains the RPC server (optionally) embedded in the client.
- `/lib/sync` Contains the various chain synchronizers and `Fetcher` helpers.
- `/test` Contains test cases, testing helper functions, mocks and test data.

**Components**

- `Chain` [**In Progress**] This class represents the blockchain and is a wrapper around
  `@ethereumjs/blockchain`. It handles creation of the data directory, provides basic blockchain operations
  and maintains an updated current state of the blockchain, including current height, total difficulty, and
  latest block.
- `Server` This class represents a server that discovers new peers and handles incoming and dropped
  connections. When a new peer connects, the `Server` class will negotiate protocols and emit a `connected`
  event with a new `Peer`instance. The peer will have properties corresponding to each protocol. For example,
  if a new peer understands the `eth` protocol, it will contain an `eth` property that provides all `eth`
  protocol methods (for example: `peer.eth.getBlockHeaders()`) - `RlpxServer` [**In Progress**] Subclass of `Server` that implements the `devp2p/rlpx` transport. - `Libp2pServer` [**In Progress**] Subclass of `Server` that implements the `libp2p` transport.
- `Peer` Represents a network peer. Instances of `Peer` are generated by the `Server`
  subclasses and contain instances of supported protocol classes as properties. Instances of `Peer` subclasses can also be used to directly connect to other nodes via the `connect()` method. Peers emit `message` events
  whenever a new message is received using any of the supported protocols. - `RlpxPeer` [**In Progress**] Subclass of `Peer` that implements the `devp2p/rlpx` transport. - `Libp2pPeer` [**In Progress**] Subclass of `Peer` that implements the `libp2p` transport.
- `Protocol` [**In Progress**] This class and subclasses provide a user-friendly wrapper around the
  low level ethereum protocols such as `eth/62`, `eth/63` and `les/2`. Subclasses must define the messages provided by the protocol. - `EthProtocol` [**In Progress**] Implements the `eth/62` and `eth/63` protocols. - `LesProtocol` [**In Progress**] Implements the `les/2` protocol. - `ShhProtocol` [**Not Started**] Implements the whisper protocol.
- `PeerPool` [**In Progress**] Represents a pool of network peers. `PeerPool` instances emit `added`
  and `removed` events when new peers are added and removed and also emit the `message` event whenever
  any of the peers in the pool emit a message. Each `Service` has an associated `PeerPool` and they are used primarily by `Synchronizer`s to help with blockchain synchronization.
- `Synchronizer` Subclasses of this class implements a specific blockchain synchronization strategy. They
  also make use of subclasses of the `Fetcher` class that help fetch headers and bodies from pool peers. The fetchers internally make use of streams to handle things like queuing and backpressure. - `FullSynchronizer` [**In Progress**] Implements full syncing of the blockchain - `LightSynchronizer` [**In Progress**] Implements light syncing of the blockchain
- `Handler` Subclasses of this class implements a protocol message handler. Handlers respond to incoming requests from peers.
  - `EthHandler` [**In Progress**] Handles incoming ETH requests
  - `LesHandler` [**In Progress**] Handles incoming LES requests
- `Service` Subclasses of `Service` will implement specific functionality of a `Client`. For example, the `EthereumService` subclasses will synchronize the blockchain using the full or light sync protocols. Each service must specify which protocols it needs and define a `start()` and `stop()` function.
  - `FullEthereumService` [**In Progress**] Implementation of ethereum full sync.
  - `LightEthereumService` [**In Progress**] Implementation of ethereum light sync.
  - `WhisperService` [**Not Started**] Implementation of an ethereum whisper node.
- `Client` [**In Progress**] Represents the top-level ethereum client, and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of included services.
- `RPCManager` [**In Progress**] Implements an embedded JSON-RPC server to handle incoming RPC requests.

## Developer

### Client Debugging

The client's logging verbosity level can be set with `--loglevel`.  Available levels are
`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`.

```shell
ethereumjs --loglevel=debug
```

If you want to have verbose logging output across the stack you can use the f

For more in-depth debugging on networking the the underlying [devp2p](../devp2p) library integrates with the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) package and can also be used from within a client execution context:

```shell
DEBUG=*,-babel [CLIENT_START_COMMAND]
```

The above command outputs the log messages from all `devp2p` debug loggers available. For a more targeted logging the different loggers can also be activated separately, e.g.:

```shell
DEBUG=devp2p:rlpx,devp2p:eth,-babel [CLIENT_START_COMMAND]
```

### Diagram Updates

To update the structure diagram files in the root folder open the `client.drawio` file in [draw.io](https://draw.io/), make your changes, and open a PR with the updated files. Export `svg` and `png` with `border` `width=20` and `transparency=false`. For `png` go to "Advanced" and select `300 DPI`.

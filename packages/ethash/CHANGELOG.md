## [1.0.0] - [UNRELEASED]

### New Package Name

**Attention!** This new version is part of a series of EthereumJS releases all moving to a
new scoped package name format. In this case the library is renamed as follows:

- `ethashjs` -> `@ethereumjs/ethash`

Please update your library references accordingly or install with:

```shell
npm i @ethereumjs/ethash
```

### Library Promisification

The `Ethash` library has been promisified and callbacks have been removed along
PR [#833](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/pull/833) and preceeding PR
[#779](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/pull/779).

Old API:

```typescript
ethash.verifyPOW(validblock, (result) => {
  console.log(result)
})
```

New API:

```typescript
const result = await ethash.verifyPOW(validBlock)
console.log(result) // => true
```

See `Ethash` [README](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/tree/master/packages/ethash#usage)
for a complete example.

| Implements schema and functions related to Ethereum's block. |
| --- |

Note: this `README` reflects the state of the library from `v3.0.0` onwards. See `README` from the [standalone repository](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block) for an introduction on the last preceeding release.

# INSTALL

`npm install @ethereumjs/block`

# USAGE

There are three static factories to instantiate a `Block` or `BlockHeader`:

- `Block.fromBlockData(blockData: BlockData = {}, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromRLPSerializedBlock(serialized: Buffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromValuesArray(values: BlockBuffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`

Instantiation Example:

```typescript
const headerData = {
  number: 15,
  parentHash: '0x6bfee7294bf44572b7266358e627f3c35105e1c3851f3de09e6d646f955725a7',
  difficulty: 131072,
  gasLimit: 8000000,
  timestamp: 1562422144,
}
const header = BlockHeader.fromHeaderData(headerData)
```

Properties of a `Block` or `BlockHeader` object are frozen with `Object.freeze()` which gives you enhanced security and consistency properties when working with the instantiated object. This behavior can be modified using the `freeze` option in the constructor if needed.

API Usage Example:

```typescript
try {
  await block.validate(blockchain)
  // Block validation has passed
} catch (err) {
  // handle errors appropriately
}
```

# API

[Documentation](./docs/README.md)

# TESTING

Tests in the `tests` directory are partly outdated and testing is primarily done by running the `BlockchainTests` from within the [ethereumjs-vm](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/tree/master/packages/vm#synopsis) package.

To avoid bloating this repository with [ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) JSON files, we usually copy specific JSON files and wrap them with some metadata (source, date, commit hash). There's a helper to aid in that process and can be found at [wrap-ethereum-test.sh](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/blob/master/packages/block/scripts/wrap-ethereum-test.sh).

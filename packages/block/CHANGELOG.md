# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
(modification: no type change headlines) and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 3.0.0-beta.1 - 2020-10-22

### New Package Name

**Attention!** This new version is part of a series of EthereumJS releases all moving to a new scoped package name format. In this case the library is renamed as follows:

- `ethereumjs-block` -> `@ethereumjs/block`

Please update your library references accordingly or install with:

```shell
npm i @ethereumjs/block
```

### TypeScript/Library Import

This is the first TypeScript based release of the library, see PR [#72](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/72).
The import structure has slightly changed along:

**TypeScript**

```typescript
import { BlockHeader } from 'ethereumjs-block'
import { Block } from 'ethereumjs-block'
```

**JavaScript/Node.js**

```javascript
const BlockHeader = require('ethereumjs-block').BlockHeader
const Block = require('ethereumjs-block').Block
```

The library now also comes with a **type declaration file** distributed
along with the package published.

### Major Refactoring - Breaking Changes

This release is a major refactoring of the block library to simplify and strengthen its code base.
Refactoring work has been done along PR [#72](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/72)
(Promises) and PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/pull/883) (refactoring of API
and internal code structure).

#### New Constructor Params

The way to instantiate a new `BlockHeader` or `Block` object has been completely reworked and is
now more explicit, less error prone and produces more `TypeScript` friendly and readable code.

The old direct constructor usage is now discouraged in favor of different dedicated static
factory methods to create new objects.

**Breaking**: While the main constructors can still be called, signatures changed significantly and
your old `new Block(...)`, `new BlockHeader(...)` instantiations won't work any more and needs to be
updated.

**BlockHeader Class**

There are three new factory methods to create a new `BlockHeader`:

1. Pass in a Header-attribute named dictionary to `BlockHeader.fromHeaderData(headerData: HeaderData = {}, opts?: BlockOptions)`:

```typescript
const headerData = {
  number: 15,
  parentHash: '0x6bfee7294bf44572b7266358e627f3c35105e1c3851f3de09e6d646f955725a7',
  difficulty: 131072,
  gasLimit: 8000000,
  timestamp: 1562422144,
}
const header = BlockHeader.fromHeaderData(headerData)
```

2. Create a `BlockHeader` from an RLP-serialized header `Buffer` with `BlockHeader.fromRLPSerializedHeader(serialized: Buffer, opts: BlockOptions)`.

```typescript
const serialized = Buffer.from(
  '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',
  'hex'
)
const header = BlockHeader.fromRLPSerializedHeader(serialized)
```

3. Create a `BlockHeader` from an array of `Buffer` values, you can do a first short roundtrip test with:

```typescript
const valuesArray = header.raw()
BlockHeader.fromValuesArray(valuesArray)
```

Generally internal types representing block header values are now closer to their domain representation
(number, difficulty, gasLimit) instead of having everthing represented as a `Buffer`.

**Block Class**

There are analogue new static factories for the `Block` class:

- `Block.fromBlockData(blockData: BlockData = {}, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromRLPSerializedBlock(serialized: Buffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromValuesArray(values: BlockBuffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`

Learn more about the full API in the [docs](./docs/README.md).

#### Immutability

The returned block is now frozen and immutable. To work with a maliable block, copy it with `const fakeBlock = Object.create(block)`.

#### Promise-based API

The API of this library is now completely promise-based and the old callback-style interface
has been dropped.

This affects the following methods of the API now being defined as `async` and
returning a `Promise`:

**Header Class**

- `BlockHeader.validate(blockchain: Blockchain, height?: BN): Promise<void>`

**Block Class**

- `Block.genTxTrie(): Promise<void>`
- `Block.validate(blockChain: Blockchain): Promise<void>`
- `Block.validateUncles(blockchain: Blockchain): Promise<void>`

Usage example:

```javascript
try {
  await block.validate(blockchain)
  // Block validation has passed
} catch (err) {
  // handle errors appropriately
}
```

### Header Validation Methods > Signature Changes

**Breaking**: The signatures of the following header validation methods have been updated to take a `parentBlockHeader` instead of a
`parentBlock` input parameter for consistency and removing a circling dependency with `Block`:

- `BlockHeader.canonicalDifficulty(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): BN`
- `BlockHeader.validateDifficulty(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.validateGasLimit(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): boolean`

On the `Block` library new corresponding methods have been added which both operate on a block instance and expect a `parentBlock`
as an input parameter.

### New Default Hardfork

**Breaking:** The default HF on the library has been updated from `petersburg` to `instanbul`, see PR [#906](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/pull/906).
The HF setting is now automatically taken from the HF set for `Common.DEAULT_HARDFORK`,
see PR [#863](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/pull/863).

### Dual ES5 and ES2017 Builds

We significantly updated our internal tool and CI setup along the work on
PR [#913](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/pull/913) with an update to `ESLint` from `TSLint`
for code linting and formatting and the introduction of a new build setup.

Packages now target `ES2017` for Node.js builds (the `main` entrypoint from `package.json`) and introduce
a separate `ES5` build distributed along using the `browser` directive as an entrypoint, see
PR [#921](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/pull/921). This will result
in performance benefits for Node.js consumers, see [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/117) for a releated discussion.

## [2.0.0] - 2018-06-25

This release introduces both support for different `chains` (`mainnet`, `ropsten`, ...)
and `hardforks` up to the latest applied HF (`byzantium`). Parameters and genesis values
are provided by the new [ethereumjs-common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common)
library which also defines the set of supported chains and forks.

Changes in detail:

- New initialization parameters `opts.chain` (default: `mainnet`) and `opts.hardfork`
  (default: `null`, block number-based behaviour), PR [#44](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/44)
- Alternatively a `Common` class object can be provided directly with the `opts.common` parameter,
  see [API](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/blob/master/packages/block/docs/index.md) docs
- Correct block validation for all know hardforks, PR
  [#47](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/47), if no hardfork is set validation logic
  is determined by block number in combination with the `chain` set
- Genesis block initialization depending on the `chain` set (see `ethereumjs-common` for supported chains)
- Extensive test additions to cover the newly introduced capabilities and changes
- Fix default value for `nonce` (empty buffer -> `<Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>`), PR [#42](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/42)
